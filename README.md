Welcome to the project! This is a great opportunity for you to hone your coding skills, contribute to a project, and build something for your portfolio. Even if you're not looking for a job in the industry, having a solid project to showcase your skills can be invaluable.

the big goal of this project is to help programmers show off their skills. a more secondary goal is to create a fun and free game.
so if your a programmer without a degree or whatever and need to prove your skill this here is an "impressive" or at least something people can't ignore as mediocre or flock or whatever.


## the big concept
its a 3d space combat sim like Freespace or colony wars. the game is mission-based. you get a briefing chose your loadout and thrown into a level, complete the main objective,go to debriefing/cinematic and repeat until the game ends. it doesn't have a story as of yet (so if your a amateur sci fi writer you can give it a go).

on the level, you will mostly have big ships and fighters, combat/dogfighting is the main game loop.

for pricing its meant to be free, even projects derived from the main one must be free. the only payment I allow is donations,meaning people don't have to pay to play this game. 

## support/donations/sponsorship

i myself have donated a lot of work time for this project already and anywhere between 2-3k dollars i put aside for "bounties" for important features.
for now there is no option to donate if your interested contact me.

why donate? simple reason, you want a feature implemented and someone to code it (its too early for that and will require contacting me).

the big donation this project needs is at least 2-3 serious programmers. art 2d/3d ,story,sound effects,music etc will also be very helpful.

more money means more bounties I can give to people to motivate them working on this project. and other logistical stuff a project like this needs.

anyone donating anything will go into the credits, I would also like to create a "hall of fame" describing in detail important contributions and about the contributing person.

about sponsorship, not much to say until this gets bigger, basically, a sponsor will mostly get traffic from banners attached to the game,and any other sources of traffic to the game (this and any other page related to this project).

## license and ownership

I am the sole owner of this project, the reason is simple, in my life I've seen many projects/business getting trashed by "partners" fighting over scraps and their ego. there can only be one owner one "chef" if you like.

the license is: Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)
it has most if not all the things I want for this project, none commercial, permission to share and change any derivative project will have the same license, and credit will be given to anyone contributing.

i do hope people will use this project to create free games other people can play and enjoy. but if you really wanna use this for commercial purposes contact me(it will have to stay free to play in any case).

## bounties 

for resolving issues (some of them)/developing features there will be a symbolic monetary "prize"/"compensation", I decide if to approve any pull request.
this is not "payment" don't relay or expect it to be something like that.
a bounty is given when an issue is resolved. if its no good you won't get it ( I did something like this before and people submitted unusable code).
you will need to contribute on at least 1 issue before you can do a bounty.
contact me before you start working on a bounty, I assign people on bounties.
until other people start funding this project I will decide which feature gets a bounty and "how much" you get for it.
if you donated you can assign your money to any bounty you want.
eventually, people will be able to vote on stuff like this, for now its too early.

## what this project needs

as i menthionded in donations:

programmers: for gamplay,gui,graphics (shaders 3d modals etc).
mostly those who are fammilier with godot and gdscript and built at least
one project and did a couple of tutorials. its a 3d game so knowing the gdscript 3d api and 3d math
will be needed for some of the features.
3d is not needed for gui and data manipulation and some gamplay logic.

game designer: for balance and features, i have ideas but im not as knowledgeble
as a game designer.

level designer(godot): somone that knows how to use the godot editor, its a powerfull tool.
in short with these tools and the modulare objects i built,ther is no need for code to 
build levels.

music and sound effects: the game has none as of now,if anyone wants to donate relvant assets,it would be 
very helpfull for the project.

story writer: somone to write the games story,cinmatics,mission brifing debrifing and any
ingame cinmatic or chatter betwwen charecters.

2d/3d art: mostly 2d for gui, for the 3d part i will need some low poly modals,most of then
i can make myself, i made the 3d missile and big ship from kennys modular space pack.
any help is welcome.

## mangment

Team structure: in most cases each contributor will work on an "issue" be it coding,3d modaling etc.
when thier done they will do a pull request which i will review and then aprove/reject.

Communication channels: a discord channel can be used for most day to day communications.
i am also avialble on skype,whatsup and email.

Development process: i post an issue(usually a new feature), a contributor asks to be assinged to it,
once the contributor resolves the issue he makes a pull request, if thers a problem its rejected,
otherwite the pull request is approved. for testing i have a person that is experienced in breaking
programs and finding bugs. for bugs the contributor responsible for that feature and me will debug and resolve it.
an issue can also be art for the game or level design etc etc.

Code of conduct: respectful communication, code quality, and collaboration.

## Future plans: 

*make a game that will be expanded by the community, as the godot editor
is a very powerful tool even none coders will be able to build levels or whole campaigns for the game.
mods, derived games, all distributed for free and credit is given to the origenal contributors (with links).
*the code shod be very modular and documented in text and videos.
*i also intend to make a multiplayer version ( i have a way to turn even "complex" games to multiplayer).
*port to more platforms.
